    "For a given 3-D discretized reservoir model, the permeability values of some gridblocks are so low that the Senior Reservoir Advisor (SRA) would like gridblocks with permeability lower than a specified cut-off value to be classified as ‘inactive’ while others are to be classified as ‘active’. Ultimately, he wants to know the numbers (counts) of gridblocks classified as ‘active’ and those classified as ‘inactive’."
