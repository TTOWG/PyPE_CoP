 Python for PetEng Educators


???????????? ?????????????????????? ?????? ?????????????????? ?????????????????????? ??????????????????
Our recent efforts to promote digital innovations in petroleum engineering (PE) curriculum design and instructional strategies were well received by our peers, both in the industry and academia! While we only rolled out the frameworks, it is only logical for us to now roll up our sleeves and implement the frameworks. Granted that there is a plan to try out the frameworks on students from various PE departments, the implementation will greatly benefit from a program that engages PE educators first. We are therefore undertaking a multi-faceted professional development (PD) program for PE educators, towards equipping them as partners in the larger project with students. We hope that this training-the-trainer approach will fast-track our progress with the students, and will ensure sustainability of our mission.

The first in the series of our PD program is code-named Python for ???????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????????????????? (????????). It is designed to be an online community featuring:
• Upskilling sessions (Learning Python)
• Peer Coaching/Mentorship
• Workshops/Seminars
• Learners' Experience design
• Collaborative study groups
• Discussion forums
• Resources sharing
• Enrolment in online courses
• Pedagogy Research

We are open to collaborations on this project.
